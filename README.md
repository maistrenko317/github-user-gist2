# REST API

NodeJS function running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework. The deployed function does not include any event definitions as well as any kind of persistence (database).

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to

```bash
Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack second-option (112s)

functions:
  handler: aws-node-project-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, we can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke --function handler
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
